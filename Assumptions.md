Assumptions made
___
1. Names cannot contain numbers in them.
2. Script1 contains titles for the individuals before starting the conversation. I added '#' characters to denote them as comments so that my processScript file ignores them.
3. There is a set that contains the names of the people in the conversation. Since Vincer offers digital products, I am assuming that each person, even if they have the same name, has their own microphone (with an ID) that could be used for some hash function so that they are always different in this set. Alternatively, name them "Chris 1" and "Chris 2."
