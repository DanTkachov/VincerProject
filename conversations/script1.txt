Chris: Hey Olivia, did you see that email about the new comp plan?

Olivia: Just opened it. Please tell me I'm misreading this. They're raising our quotas by 30% but

keeping the OTE the same?

Chris: That's exactly what they're doing. And they're stretching out the accelerators too. Used to

kick in at 80% attainment, now it's 100%.

Olivia: This is insane. I barely hit 110% last year with the old quota, and that was working nights

and weekends. There's no way I can hit 130% of that.

Chris: None of us can. I ran the numbers—if I closed every single opportunity in my pipeline,

including the "aspirational" ones, I'd still only hit about 85% of this new number.

Olivia: So basically they're cutting our pay while pretending they're not. Classic corporate move.

Chris: Exactly. And the timing couldn't be worse. I just put a deposit down on a new house

based on what I earned last year. Now I'm looking at potentially making 40% less.

Olivia: I'm sorry, that's rough. I've got my kid starting college next fall, and these student loans

aren't going to pay themselves.

Chris: It's just so frustrating. We hit our targets, grew the business 25% last year, and our

reward is... making it nearly impossible to earn the same income?

Olivia: Meanwhile, the executives still get their full bonuses regardless. I saw the CEO's new

vacation photos on LinkedIn. Nice yacht.

Chris: Right? And the justification is laughable. "Market conditions" and "aligning incentives with

company goals." How about aligning my mortgage payment with my bank account?

Olivia: The worst part is feeling completely powerless. It's not like we can negotiate individually.

It's take it or leave it.

Chris: Exactly. And they know the job market is tight right now. Where am I going to go? Every

other SaaS company is doing the same thing—raising quotas, trimming commissions.

Olivia: It feels like they're just seeing how far they can push before people quit. But they know

most of us can't afford to walk away.

Chris: That's exactly it. They're banking on our golden handcuffs. I've been here five

years—that's a lot of vested stock options to leave on the table if I go somewhere else.

Olivia: Same. Plus, who wants to start over at a new company, rebuilding a pipeline from

scratch? That's at least 6-9 months of reduced income while you ramp up.

Chris: It's a trap. And watch—when we don't hit these unrealistic targets, they'll blame us.

"Performance issues" rather than admitting they set impossible goals.

Olivia: Of course. Never mind that our product is now more expensive than most competitors,

we've had serious platform stability issues for months, and three of our biggest differentiators

are now standard features everywhere else.

Chris: But somehow that's our problem to overcome with our "sales skills." As if we can just talk

customers into ignoring reality.

Olivia: Right? My last prospect literally pulled up a comparison chart showing our competitor

offering the same capabilities for 20% less. What am I supposed to say to that?

Chris: And we're the ones who have to face customers every day with pricing that makes no

sense. Meanwhile, Product and Marketing sit in their ivory tower setting prices without any

understanding of what we're up against.

Olivia: Completely detached from reality. Did you try bringing this up with Jake?

Chris: Our fearless sales leader? Yeah, he just parroted the company line. "We need to increase

productivity per rep." As if we're just being lazy.

Olivia: Typical. These targets aren't about what's actually possible; they're about what Finance

put in a spreadsheet to make the investors happy.

Chris: Exactly. Some 26-year-old MBA who's never sold anything in his life decided we can just

magically close 30% more business in a down market with a product that hasn't substantially

improved in a year.

Olivia: And we're the ones who have to live with the consequences. I'm already stressed about

making my mortgage payment next quarter if this pipeline doesn't materialize.

Chris: I'm right there with you. I've already started cutting back on expenses, canceled our

summer vacation plans. My partner isn't thrilled.

Olivia: I'm looking at pulling money from my 401k if things get really tight. Which is exactly what

I didn't want to do at this stage in my career.

Chris: That's rough. It shouldn't be this way. We hit our numbers, the company's profitable, but

somehow we're the ones feeling the squeeze.

Olivia: That's corporate America for you. Privatize the gains, socialize the losses. Execs still get

their bonuses while we're tightening our belts.

Chris: What's your plan? Are you going to start looking elsewhere?

Olivia: Honestly, I'm updating my resume this weekend. Not sure what's out there, but I can't just

sit back and accept this. You?

Chris: I'm giving it one more quarter to see if these targets are as impossible as they look. If I'm

tracking well below, I'll start putting out feelers. Though who knows if any company is better right

now.

Olivia: That's the depressing part. This seems to be the trend everywhere. More pressure, less

compensation, higher expectations.

Chris: Exactly. And they wonder why sales roles have the highest turnover and burnout rates.

Olivia: Speaking of burnout—how are you holding up otherwise? You look tired, to be honest.

Chris: Thanks for noticing. [laughs] Haven't been sleeping well. Keep waking up at 3 AM

calculating how many more deals I need to close to make my daughter's tuition payment.

Olivia: I feel that. I literally had a nightmare about my pipeline last night. Dreamt that all my

committed deals simultaneously pushed to next quarter.

Chris: The sales rep nightmare special. I had a similar one where I showed up to a final

presentation and realized I was pitching the wrong product to the wrong company.

Olivia: [laughs] Our brains are so creative with the anxiety. Well, at least we can commiserate

together.

Chris: Small comfort, but I'll take it. Want to grab lunch later? We can strategize how to defy

mathematical reality and hit these new quotas.

Olivia: Sure, why not? Maybe we can figure out how to clone ourselves to work twice as many

hours.

Chris: Now there's an idea. Though knowing our leadership, they'd just raise the quota again.

Olivia: [laughs] Too true. See you at 12:30?

Chris: I'll be there. Assuming none of my deals implode between now and then.
