Jessica: Morning, Nate. You look... exhausted.

Nate: That obvious, huh? I was up until 2 AM finishing a custom demo for the Brightline

opportunity. Their CTO had some last-minute requirements.

Jessica: 2 AM? That's rough. When's the demo?

Nate: 10 AM today. So I got about four hours of sleep, and now I'm mainlining coffee just to form

coherent sentences.

Jessica: I feel that. I've been averaging maybe five hours of sleep for the past three weeks. End

of quarter is killing me.

Nate: It never seems to get better, does it? Even after the quarter ends, there's just a new

quarter with new targets waiting.

Jessica: Exactly. I can't remember the last time I had a week that didn't include at least one late

night and one weekend work session. It's becoming my default state.

Nate: Same here. My partner pointed out yesterday that we haven't had dinner together before

8 PM in months. I'm always on calls that run late or catching up on proposals.

Jessica: At least you're having dinner together. My relationship ended last month, and if I'm

being honest, work was a big factor. He got tired of being the only one making plans and then

watching me cancel them half the time.

Nate: I'm sorry to hear that. Though I get it. My partner and I had a huge fight last weekend

because I was on my laptop during our anniversary dinner. Had to respond to an "urgent" RFP

question.

Jessica: Was it actually urgent?

Nate: Of course not. Could have easily waited until Monday. But in the moment, everything feels

urgent, you know? The constant fear that if you don't respond immediately, you'll lose the deal.

Jessica: I know exactly what you mean. That constant low-grade anxiety that follows you

everywhere. I woke up in a panic at 4 AM yesterday because I dreamt I forgot to send a

follow-up email to a prospect.

Nate: The sales stress dreams are real. I regularly dream about missing meetings or showing up

unprepared. Then I wake up and check my calendar in the middle of the night just to make sure.

Jessica: It's taking a toll on my health too. My doctor says my blood pressure is concerning, and

I've gained 15 pounds this year from stress eating and no time to exercise.

Nate: Same boat. I used to run every morning, but now that time is spent answering overnight

emails from global accounts. I can literally feel my fitness declining while my stress increases.

Jessica: And the worst part is, the company pretends to care about wellbeing. Did you see that

email about the new "wellness initiative" last week?

Nate: [sarcastic] Oh, you mean the optional lunch-and-learn about stress management that

none of us have time to attend because we're too busy being stressed?

Jessica: [laughs] Precisely! "Take an hour for your mental health, but also make sure you don't

miss any client calls or fall behind on your pipeline."

Nate: It's so tone-deaf. If they actually cared about our wellbeing, they'd staff the teams properly

so we're not all doing the work of two people.

Jessica: Or set reasonable targets that don't require working 60+ hours a week to achieve. But

that would cut into the profit margins, so instead we get a lunch seminar about breathing

exercises.

Nate: Meanwhile, I literally don't have time to breathe most days. I had back-to-back calls from 8

AM to 6 PM yesterday with no breaks. Had to eat lunch while on mute and pray no one asked

me a direct question while I was chewing.

Jessica: Been there. I've gotten really good at the strategic mute button eating technique.

Though last week I forgot I was on video and got caught stuffing a sandwich in my face during a

customer call.

Nate: [laughs] Nice. I've taken calls from everywhere at this pointâ€”my car, bathroom stalls,

once from a changing room while shopping because a prospect suddenly had "5 minutes to

chat."

Jessica: The customer urgency that's rarely actually urgent is the worst. I rearranged my entire

day last week for an "emergency" call with a prospect who then spent the first 15 minutes

making small talk.

Nate: And you can't say no because what if this is THE call that makes or breaks the deal? So

you just keep accommodating increasingly unreasonable requests.

Jessica: Exactly. I missed my nephew's birthday party on Saturday for a "critical" call with a

prospect in APAC. The guy showed up 20 minutes late and then admitted he hadn't reviewed

any of our previous discussions.

Nate: That's infuriating. But the alternative is potentially missing your number, so you just keep

sacrificing personal time on the altar of potential commission.

Jessica: And it's never enough. Hit your number this quarter? Great, here's a bigger one for next

quarter. Exceed your target? Awesome, we've increased your quota accordingly.

Nate: The hamster wheel never stops. Sometimes I fantasize about just... walking away. Getting

some low-stress job where I'm not constantly on the edge of a nervous breakdown.

Jessica: What would you do instead?

Nate: Honestly? Anything with predictable hours and less pressure. My friend works in

government and leaves at 5 PM every day. Never checks email on weekends. Sounds like a

dream.

Jessica: I've had similar thoughts. My college roommate is a teacher. She works hard during the

school year but gets actual vacations where she fully disconnects. I haven't fully disconnected in

four years.

Nate: Even our "vacations" are just working remotely from slightly nicer locations. I was in

Hawaii last summer and spent half of each day on my laptop in the hotel room.

Jessica: My last vacation, I ended up taking a customer call from a bathroom at Disney World.

Standing next to Mickey Mouse while discussing implementation timelines. Surreal.

Nate: We've normalized something that's actually completely insane. Constantly available,

constantly anxious, constantly exhausted.

Jessica: And for what? The money's good, but at what point is it not worth the cost to our health

and relationships?

Nate: I ask myself that question more and more lately. Especially on mornings like today when

I'm running on fumes but still have to somehow sound energetic and convincing to a prospect in

a few hours.

Jessica: It's not sustainable. Something's gotta give. For me, it was my relationship. For others,

it's their health.

Nate: I'm worried about both. My partner's patience is wearing thin, and my doctor's been

warning me about my stress levels for months.

Jessica: Have you thought about looking for another role? Maybe something internal with more

regular hours?

Nate: All the time. But then I look at my commission check and talk myself into staying "just one

more quarter." The golden handcuffs are real.

Jessica: I hear that. Plus, in this economy, who knows if the grass is actually greener

elsewhere? Might just be trading one burnout factory for another.

Nate: Exactly. And starting over at a new company means rebuilding a pipeline from scratch,

which means even more pressure and hours initially.

Jessica: It's a trap with no easy escape. Anyway, I should let you prepare for your demo. 10 AM,

right?

Nate: Yeah, and I still need to run through it at least once more. Wish me luck functioning on

four hours of sleep.

Jessica: Good luck. Maybe we can grab coffee after? I could use the caffeine too.

Nate: Sounds good. I'll need it to get through my afternoon calls. The glamorous sales life

continues.
