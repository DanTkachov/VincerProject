Jordan: Hey Taylor, how's your quarter going?

Taylor: [sighs] Not great. Two weeks left and I'm still 40% away from quota. You?

Jordan: About the same. I'm drowning over here trying to find enough qualified opportunities to

fill my pipeline. Marketing keeps sending me leads that are nowhere near ready to buy.

Taylor: Tell me about it. Last week I got an MQL that was literally just someone downloading our

whitepaper for a college assignment. Not even in the workforce yet!

Jordan: [laughs] At least they were honest. Half my leads don't even respond to the first

outreach. And when they do, they're shocked we're contacting them. "I just wanted the free

template, I'm not looking to buy anything."

Taylor: Exactly! And then in our sales meeting, the VP is like, "Why aren't you converting more

MQLs to SQLs?" I don't know, maybe because they're not actual prospects?

Jordan: Right? And the marketing team just cares about hitting their lead volume targets.

Quality? Who needs it!

Taylor: The worst is when they run these flashy campaigns that bring in hundreds of leads, and

we have to sort through all of them to find maybe two or three that are worth pursuing.

Jordan: And then our conversion metrics look terrible, so we get blamed for "not following up

properly." Like, I'm following up! They're just not interested!

Taylor: It's a complete waste of time. Meanwhile, my calendar's packed with discovery calls for

"hot leads" that turn out to be students, competitors, or people three levels below the

decision-maker with zero buying power.

Jordan: And then my manager asks why I'm not prospecting enough. Um, because I'm spending

all my time qualifying your so-called "qualified leads"?

Taylor: Exactly! Yesterday I had four back-to-back discovery calls, and not one of them had

budget or authority. Complete waste of three hours.

Jordan: That's brutal. Have you brought it up with marketing?

Taylor: Multiple times. They just show me their metrics about how many people are downloading

content and filling out forms. But they don't track whether those people are actually in our ICP or

have buying intent.

Jordan: Same here. They're living in a different reality. All they care about is volume. "Look at all

these leads we're generating!" Yeah, great, but can any of them actually buy our product?

Taylor: Right? And don't get me started on the messaging. Half the time, prospects say, "That's

not what your website said you do." I have to spend the first 20 minutes of every call just

clearing up misconceptions from our marketing.

Jordan: [laughs] I had a call last week where the prospect thought we were a completely

different type of platform because the language on the landing page was so vague and jargony.

Taylor: Classic. And then when I bring it up to the CMO, he just says, "Well, you're the sales

expert, you should be able to pivot the conversation." As if it's somehow easier to sell when the

prospect is actively confused about what we do!

Jordan: It's so frustrating. And meanwhile, we're expected to hit these aggressive quotas with

pipelines full of junk.

Taylor: Exactly. My director keeps saying, "Just create your own pipeline through outbound."

Which I do! But that's not supposed to be my entire job. If marketing isn't providing any real

leads, what are they even there for?

Jordan: And outbound is getting harder too. Response rates are in the toilet. I'm lucky if I get a

1% reply rate on cold emails.

Taylor: I know! LinkedIn is completely saturated. Everyone ignores InMails now. And cold

calling? Forget it. I'm lucky if I get past the gatekeeper once a day.

Jordan: It feels like our targets keep going up, but the resources to hit them keep going down.

My quota increased 20% this year, but I've got the same crappy leads, the same outdated sales

collateral, and now fewer SDRs supporting my territory.

Taylor: That's rough. Our SDR team just had layoffs too. So now I'm supposed to do my job and

half of theirs.

Jordan: Exactly! I spent three hours yesterday just building lists and finding contact info. That's

not what I was hired to do!

Taylor: And nobody up the chain seems to care. It's just, "Hit your number or else." They don't

want to hear about marketing alignment or lead quality or any of the actual problems.

Jordan: It's because they don't want to admit that there's an issue they can't easily fix. Easier to

just blame the sales team for "not hustling enough."

Taylor: [sarcastic] Right, because if I just "hustle harder," suddenly all these non-prospects will

magically turn into qualified buyers with budget authority! Why didn't I think of that?

Jordan: [laughs] Just use your magic sales powers! If you were a real closer, you could

convince that college freshman to sign a six-figure enterprise agreement!

Taylor: Totally! Or maybe I should just close my marketing team instead, since apparently they

need the most education on what our product actually does and who it's for!

Jordan: [laughs] Now that would be a valuable use of your sales skills! So what are you doing to

try to save your quarter?

Taylor: Honestly? I'm reaching out to every closed-lost opportunity from the past year to see if

anything's changed. It's desperate, but I'm running out of options.

Jordan: I feel that. I've been hitting up my network for referrals, but that well is starting to run dry

too.

Taylor: The worst part is, I know I'm a good sales rep. My close rates are solid when I get in

front of the right people. But I can't control who marketing brings in, or what messaging they put

out, or how much noise is in the market.

Jordan: Exactly. It's so demoralizing to feel like no matter how hard you work, your success

depends on factors completely outside your control.

Taylor: And then to get blamed when those factors don't align? It's infuriating.

Jordan: Well, misery loves company, I guess. At least we're both in the same boat.

Taylor: True. Let me know if you figure out the secret to turning garbage leads into gold. I could

use the help.

Jordan: Will do. Same to you. Good luck these next two weeks.

Taylor: Thanks, I'm going to need it. You too.
