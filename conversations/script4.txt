Michael: Hey Gabriela, got a minute? Need to vent before my next call or I might lose it on this

customer.

Gabriela: Sure, what's up? You look stressed.

Michael: [frustrated] Just got off the phone with the Westridge team. They want to sign the

contract this week—great news, right? Except our legal team says there's a minimum

three-week review period for any contract over $100K. No exceptions.

Gabriela: Let me guess—customer's fiscal year is ending, and they need to use the budget now

or lose it?

Michael: Exactly. They literally can't wait three weeks. Their procurement deadline is Friday. I've

been working this deal for nine months, and now it might evaporate because our internal

processes are stuck in 2010.

Gabriela: I feel your pain. Had almost the exact same situation last quarter with a healthcare

client. Lost a $350K deal because legal wouldn't expedite the review. Still bitter about that

commission check.

Michael: It's maddening. And my leadership's response? "You should have brought legal in

earlier." I've been trying to get them involved for a month! They kept saying, "We don't review

until there's a redlined contract."

Gabriela: The classic catch-22. Can't get legal involved early, but also somehow should have

involved them earlier.

Michael: Precisely. And now my quota is at risk because of a process I have zero control over.

Meanwhile, the customer keeps asking why a "nimble tech company" has more bureaucracy

than their 100-year-old insurance firm.

Gabriela: That's embarrassing. But I totally get it. Last week I had a customer ready to start

implementation immediately. Super excited, budget approved, just waiting on our team. Then I

find out our onboarding queue is six weeks long. Six weeks!

Michael: Let me guess—they weren't happy about that timeline?

Gabriela: They were shocked. Their direct competitor is already using a similar solution, so

every week of delay puts them further behind. And there's absolutely nothing I can do to

expedite it.

Michael: That's the part that kills me. We're held responsible for customer satisfaction and

hitting revenue targets, but we have zero authority to influence the systems and processes that

directly impact those outcomes.

Gabriela: It's completely backward. Yesterday I spent three hours on a call with a prospect

walking through our security protocols. They had specific questions about our SSO

implementation that I couldn't answer because the security team refuses to share those details

with sales.

Michael: Infuriating. And then the security team wonders why deals stall in the technical

validation phase.

Gabriela: Exactly! I literally had to tell an enterprise prospect, "I can't answer that question, but

I'll get back to you," knowing full well that our security team takes 48-72 hours to respond to

anything. Meanwhile, the competition's on the call with their security engineer right there.

Michael: The silos in this company are unreal. Last month I needed a custom payment schedule

for a customer—nothing crazy, just quarterly instead of annual billing. Took two weeks and nine

different approvals to get it done.

Gabriela: And I bet the customer was asking for daily updates the whole time.

Michael: Daily is generous. Try hourly. Meanwhile, I'm chasing people down internally to push it

through the process, all while trying to maintain the customer's trust. It's exhausting.

Gabriela: The worst is when the internal teams have no sense of urgency because it's not their

commission on the line. To them, it's just another ticket in the queue.

Michael: Precisely. Revenue Operations keeps telling me my request is "in the backlog" as if

that's at all helpful. This is a $200K ARR deal that could disappear because they can't prioritize

a simple contract amendment.

Gabriela: And then when the deal pushes or falls apart, guess who gets blamed? Not Legal. Not

RevOps. Not the archaic approval process. Us.

Michael: Every time. My VP literally asked in our last pipeline review why I "let" the Johnson

deal slip to next quarter. Let it slip? I've been fighting our internal bureaucracy for weeks trying

to get it closed!

Gabriela: It's like they think we enjoy missing our quota and losing commission. As if we're

deliberately sabotaging our own income.

Michael: Right? Why would I choose to make less money? It makes no sense. But they refuse

to acknowledge the systemic issues that are actually causing these problems.

Gabriela: And don't get me started on our pricing approval process. Had a customer last week

ask for a 10% discount—totally standard in our industry. Took five days and four levels of

approval to get it signed off.

Michael: By which point the customer's momentum had cooled, I'm guessing?

Gabriela: Completely. They went from "ready to sign today" to "we'll review this next month." All

because we couldn't respond at the speed of business.

Michael: It's death by a thousand cuts. Each individual process or approval might make sense in

isolation, but when you stack them all together, it's impossible to close deals efficiently.

Gabriela: And meanwhile, more agile competitors are eating our lunch. I lost two deals last

quarter to smaller companies that could simply move faster. Their whole sales cycle was shorter

than just our legal review.

Michael: That's what I'm up against with Westridge. Our competitor apparently turned around

their contract in 48 hours. Meanwhile, I can't even get Legal to look at ours for another week.

Gabriela: Have you tried escalating to your VP? Sometimes that's the only way to break through

the bureaucracy.

Michael: Three times. He says he "understands the frustration" but we need to "respect the

process." Translation: You're on your own, buddy.

Gabriela: Typical. Leadership talks about being "customer-centric" in all-hands meetings, then

enforces policies that directly harm the customer experience.

Michael: The cognitive dissonance is astounding. Yesterday our CEO sent a company-wide

email about "moving with urgency" and "eliminating friction." I almost replied with screenshots of

our 14-step contract approval workflow.

Gabriela: [laughs] I would have paid to see that. The worst part is, I know exactly how this ends

for Westridge. Either they walk away frustrated, or you have to offer them a massive discount to

make up for the delay.

Michael: And guess who takes the hit on that discount? Not the company—my commission. So

I'm financially penalized for problems I didn't create and can't fix.

Gabriela: It's a broken system. We're incentivized on results but have no control over the

processes that determine those results.

Michael: Exactly. And it takes a real mental toll. I lay awake at night stressing about deals that

are stuck in internal limbo, knowing there's literally nothing I can do to move them forward.

Gabriela: I know that feeling all too well. Last night I was up until 2 AM drafting a follow-up email

to a prospect, knowing full well that the real blocker isn't my communication—it's our byzantine

internal processes.

Michael: It's demoralizing. Sometimes I wonder why I stay in sales when so much of my

success depends on factors completely outside my control.

Gabriela: I ask myself the same question regularly. The income is good, but the constant stress

of fighting internal battles while maintaining a positive front for customers is exhausting.

Michael: And it never seems to improve. Every quarter there's a new initiative to "streamline

processes," but somehow we end up with more steps, not fewer.

Gabriela: That's because those initiatives are led by people who don't actually have to use the

processes. They add steps that make sense from a risk or compliance perspective without

considering the real-world impact on deals.

Michael: Precisely. I spent 30 minutes yesterday filling out a new "solution validation form" that

asks for information already captured in three other systems. Pure redundancy that adds zero

value.

Gabriela: But heaven forbid you skip it—then it's a "process violation" that gets flagged to your

manager. As if we're not busy enough actually selling.

Michael: I should probably go prepare for my next call with Westridge. Somehow I need to

convince them that we're a modern, efficient company while also explaining why our contract

process is slower than the DMV.

Gabriela: Good luck with that impossible task. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.

Michael: Thanks for listening. Sometimes just venting to someone who gets it helps maintain my

sanity.

Gabriela: Anytime. We're all in this together, fighting the same uphill battle against the very

systems that should be supporting us.
