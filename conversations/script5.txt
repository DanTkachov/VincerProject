Jake: [entering break room, looking tired] Oh hey, Marissa. Didn't expect anyone else to be here

at 7:30.

Marissa: Early call with APAC. Just finished. You look... rough, if you don't mind me saying.

Jake: [sighs] That obvious, huh? Been having these weird chest pains the last couple weeks.

Finally went to the doctor yesterday.

Marissa: That sounds serious. What did they say?

Jake: Nothing life-threatening, thankfully. But apparently my blood pressure is "alarmingly high"

for someone my age, and I'm showing early signs of an ulcer. Doctor literally wrote "extreme

work stress" on my chart.

Marissa: I'm sorry to hear that, but I can't say I'm surprised. You've been pulling 12-hour days

consistently for what, the last six months?

Jake: At least. This McLaren deal has been all-consuming. Plus three other enterprise

opportunities that decided to heat up simultaneously. I can't remember the last time I ate dinner

before 9 PM.

Marissa: I've been there. Last year I ended up in the ER with what I thought was a heart attack.

Turned out to be severe anxiety and exhaustion. Doctor said if I didn't change something, the

next time it would be a real heart attack.

Jake: Did you make changes?

Marissa: Tried to. Lasted about three weeks before quarter-end pressure ramped up again. You

know how it is—the intention is there, but when your entire financial future is tied to hitting a

number, health concerns take a back seat.

Jake: That's exactly it. Doctor gave me this whole lifestyle modification plan—exercise daily,

reduce caffeine, practice mindfulness, get 8 hours of sleep. I just sat there thinking, "Does he

have any idea what my job is like?"

Marissa: [laughs] 8 hours of sleep? In enterprise sales? I'm lucky if I get 5 uninterrupted hours

before my phone starts blowing up with texts from EMEA.

Jake: Right? And the caffeine thing is a non-starter. I'm already on my third coffee this morning,

and it's not even 8 AM. It's either that or fall asleep during my back-to-back demo calls.

Marissa: The physical toll of this job is real, though. I've gained 25 pounds in the last two years.

Combination of stress eating, no time to exercise, and living on airport food during business

trips.

Jake: I've had the opposite problem—lost 15 pounds because I regularly work through lunch

and dinner. My partner says I look "gaunt." Not exactly a compliment.

Marissa: The sleep deprivation is what gets me. I wake up multiple times each night thinking

about deals or checking my phone. Haven't had a full night's sleep in God knows how long.

Jake: Same here. And my memory is shot. Yesterday I completely blanked on a prospect's

name during a call—someone I've been talking to weekly for two months. Just gone from my

brain mid-sentence.

Marissa: Stress brain. I get that too. Last week I showed up for a meeting on the wrong day.

Drove 45 minutes to their office only to find out the meeting was tomorrow. Never made that

mistake in my entire career until now.

Jake: It's scary, right? Sometimes I wonder about the long-term effects. My dad had his first

heart attack at 45. At this rate, I'll beat his record.

Marissa: That's concerning. Have you talked to your manager about it at all?

Jake: [sarcastic laugh] Yeah, briefly. His response was to recommend a meditation app, then

immediately ask for an updated forecast on my at-risk deals.

Marissa: Sounds about right. My director sends these wellness articles to the team—"10 Ways

to Reduce Stress"—and then schedules mandatory 7 AM pipeline reviews that create more

stress than anything else in my week.

Jake: The cognitive dissonance is amazing. "Take care of yourself! But also be available 24/7

and hit these increasingly impossible targets."

Marissa: And don't forget to "bring your whole self to work"—except the parts that get sick, tired,

or need personal time.

Jake: [laughs] Exactly. The doctor actually suggested I take some time off. I just nodded,

knowing there's no way I can step away right now. Not with where my pipeline stands.

Marissa: The eternal catch-22. You need the break for your health, but taking it would create

more stress about falling behind or missing quota.

Jake: Plus there's the unspoken cultural thing. Nobody wants to be perceived as the rep who

"can't handle it" or needs special accommodation.

Marissa: The toxic hustle culture is real. I was on a team call last week where people were

actually bragging about working through their vacations. Like it's some badge of honor.

Jake: And leadership reinforces it. Have you noticed how they always celebrate the "road

warriors" who are constantly traveling and working insane hours? Never the people who

maintain healthy boundaries.

Marissa: Oh absolutely. At the last sales kickoff, they gave an award to Mark for "most dedicated

team member"—guy who worked through his honeymoon and missed the birth of his child for a

customer meeting.

Jake: And everyone applauded! As if that's something to aspire to rather than a tragic failure of

priorities.

Marissa: The normalization of self-destruction is what gets me. We're all killing ourselves slowly,

and it's treated as the cost of doing business.

Jake: My partner's been pushing me to look for something else. Says no job is worth sacrificing

my health for. Hard to argue with that when I'm taking prescription medication at 34 because of

work-induced hypertension.

Marissa: Have you considered looking elsewhere?

Jake: Constantly. But I wonder if it would really be any different. Seems like this is just the reality

of enterprise sales everywhere.

Marissa: That's what keeps me from making a move too. Devil you know versus devil you don't.

And at least here my territory is established. Starting over somewhere else means rebuilding a

pipeline from scratch, which is its own kind of stress.

Jake: Exactly. Plus I'm only two years away from being fully vested in my stock options. Walking

away from that feels impossible, even with the health concerns.

Marissa: The golden handcuffs. I get it. I'm paying for two kids in college—can't exactly take a

step back compensation-wise, even if it would add years to my life.

Jake: It's a depressing calculation, isn't it? Literally trading our health for money.

Marissa: And not even guaranteed money! That's the part that really gets me. We sacrifice all

this wellbeing for the chance at hitting quota and making commission, but there's no certainty.

Jake: Tell me about it. Last quarter I worked myself to the bone, ended up at 98% of quota

because a deal pushed at the last minute. All that health cost for essentially no financial benefit.

Marissa: Been there too many times. Anyway, I should head to my next call. But seriously, take

care of yourself, Jake. That chest pain is your body sending you a message.

Jake: I know you're right. I'm going to try to at least implement some of the easier

changes—drinking more water, taking actual lunch breaks, maybe some brief walks between

calls.

Marissa: That's a start. And if you ever need to vent about it, you know where to find me.

Usually here, caffeinated and stressed. [laughs]

Jake: [laughs] Thanks, Marissa. Same goes for you. We've got to look out for
