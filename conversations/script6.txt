Chill Bob: Man I am feeling great today, no stress at all.
Relaxed Rob: I'm feeling the same way, my favorite team won last night after all!
Chill Bob: It's so great that our job lets my control how I decide to do my work, I'm the expert after all!
Relaxed Rob: Yeah I especially like how there is absolutely no conflict here. Makes working a pleasure!
Chill Bob: Right!
Relaxed Rob: Though, I do wish my role only required me to do one or two things, right now I have to juggle 4 different things to do!
